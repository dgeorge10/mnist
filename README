DISCLAIMER:

This model can be inaccuate with the mouse-drawn numbers.
It performs better on the dataset itself.
This is probably because the dimensions of the images for 
the mouse-drawn numbers are different than the trained data-set.
I intent to improve this accurace once classes end.
Here is the output from the training:
